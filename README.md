## üìñ Usage Guide

### Adding Your First Book
1. **Click "Add Book"**: Located in the main content area next to the sort controls
2. **Auto-Fill Option**: Enter an ISBN-13 and tab out to automatically populate book information
3. **Manual Entry**: Fill in details manually:
   - Enter title, author, and genre (from dropdown)
   - Add image URL for book cover (with live preview)
   - Set page count and publication date
   - Select reading status and choose format(s): Physical, Kindle, and/or Audiobook (max 3)
   - Add series information if applicable (name and decimal number)
   - Write a synopsis (1000 character limit with counter)
   - Add start/end dates and personal rating (required for finished books)
4. **Save**: Click "Add Book" to save to your cloud database

### Managing Your Library
- **Search**: Use the header search bar to find books across title, author, format, and genre
- **Filter**: Use the left sidebar to filter by:
  - Genre (multiple selections)
  - Page count ranges
  - Format types
  - Reading status
  - Series names (with series-aware sorting)
  - Publisher
  - Estimated reading time
- **Sort**: Choose from various sorting options with series-aware sorting when filtering by series
- **View Details**: Click any book card to see full information and edit options
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes automatically sync to your cloud database

### Using Dark Mode
1. **Access Settings**: Click the "Settings" button in the top-right corner
2. **Toggle Theme**: Use the dark mode switch to change themes
3. **Automatic Saving**: Your preference is saved and restored on future visits

### Using Google Books API
1. **Enter ISBN-13**: Type or paste a 13-digit ISBN in the ISBN field
2. **Auto-Lookup**: Tab out of the field or click the üîç button to trigger lookup
3. **Review Information**: Google Books will auto-fill title, author, synopsis, cover image, etc.
4. **Edit as Needed**: All auto-filled information can be modified before saving
5. **Manual Entry**: You can still add books manually without using the API

### Configuration Setup

#### For Local Development (Private Use):
1. **Copy Template**: Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`
2. **Add Secure Credentials**: Update `config.js` with your real Supabase credentials and secure passwords
3. **Private Storage**: `config.js` is automatically gitignored and never committed to version control

#### For GitHub Pages Deployment (Public Demo):
1. **Use Production Config**: `config.production.js` is already set up with demo credentials
2. **Public Visibility**: These credentials will be publicly visible on GitHub Pages
3. **Demo Purpose**: Use simple demo passwords like `demo`/`demo123`

#### How It Works:
- **Local Development**: App tries to load `config.js` first (private, secure)
- **GitHub Pages**: Falls back to `config.production.js` (public, demo)
- **Database Connection**: App automatically connects to Supabase if configured
- **Fallback Mode**: Uses local storage if database connection fails

**Security Note**: `config.js` contains your private credentials and is gitignored. `config.production.js` is public and should only contain demo credentials.

## üìä Book Data Format

Books are stored in Supabase PostgreSQL database with local JSON fallback. The data structure includes:

- Try the manual lookup button (üîç) if auto-lookup fails
- ISBN must be 10+ characters for lookup to trigger
- Not all books may be available in Google Books database

**Filter/Search issues**:
- Clear all active filters using the "Clear All Filters" button
- Refresh the page to reset the application state
